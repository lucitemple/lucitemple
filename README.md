My name is Luci Temple and I'm a purpose-driven front-end software engineer based in Melbourne, Australia.

I strive to do good work, with good people, for a good purpose.

- ðŸ”­ I work with great people at an amazing med-tech software startup [Annalise AI][3], using technologies like React, TypeScript, Jest and Node, to build a product that literally helps saves lives.
- ðŸ‘¯ In the past Iâ€™ve collaborated on for-purpose projects, such as [Code For Australia][4]'s Civic Makers [seechange][5] project and [CodeSydney][6]'s [PAACT][7] project. 
- ðŸŒ± I'm primarily skilling up in the technologies I use at work, and also slowly working my way through [fullstack open][8] in my free time.

You can find me on [![LinkedIn][2.2]][2] or [![Twitter][1.2]][1], or checkout my old training [portfolio webpage][9] (which hasn't been updated since I got my new job).
