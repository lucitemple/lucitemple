My name is Luci Temple and I'm a purpose-driven front-end web developer based in Wollongong, Australia.

You could say Iâ€™ve taken the scenic route to frontend web development, after a couple decades doing other stuff - activism,  marketing, communications, screenwriting, filmmaking, advertising, bookselling, telemarketing, entrepreneurialism, volunteering, parentingâ€¦ 

I strive to do good work, with good people, for a good purpose.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on building a portfolio of projects to showcase my skills.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on for-purpose projects.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning React.js & Cypress

I'm available for part-time local or remote work.
